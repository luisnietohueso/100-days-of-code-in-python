Currently, I am actively taking part in the 100 Days of Code challenge, specifically focused around Python programming. This challenge involves dedicating a minimum of one hour every day for 100 consecutive days to coding. I am making consistent progress towards my goal and am thrilled to continue my journey of learning and enhancing my Python programming skills.
