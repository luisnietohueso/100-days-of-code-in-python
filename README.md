    <h1># 100-days-of-code-in-python</h1>
    <p>Currently, I am actively participating in the 100 Days of Code challenge, which focuses on coding in Python. This challenge requires me to code for at least one hour every day for 100 consecutive days. I am making steady progress towards my goal and am excited to continue learning and improving my skills in Python programming.</p>
